\section{System implications} 
\label{sec:implications}

Current researches of NVMM put them on the memory bus, but do not wipe out
DRAM. They still use DRAM to store some data structures~\cite{BPFS, PMFS},
and the operating system is still running on DRAM.

~\cite{systemimplications} shows the implications for a NVMM-only
system. It addresses several changes and challenges to current system design,
such as paging and application running model. A NVMM-only system may benefit
from the persistency of NVMM for fast recovery, but also meets the security
and privacy issue which current system does not have. How to design a
NVMM-only system is still in exploration.
