\section{Recovery} 
\label{sec:recovery}

Several early researches focus on how to recovery the system with NVMMs.
RVM~\cite{RVM} is an efficient, portable and easily used implementation of
recoverable virtual memory for Unix enviorments. By eliminating the support
for nesting, distribution and concurrency control, the implementation of 
RVM becomes very simple and easy to use. RVM manages recoverable memory in
segments, each with a file or a disk partition as backing store. Applications
calls the interfaces provided by RVM to begin and commit transactions. RVM
uses a undo/redo logging strategy to make the persistency guarantee. Old values
are copied to undo log, while new values are written to the redo log. Applications call log control commands to force redo log to write into the disks
and become persistent.
