Three emerging non-volatile memory technologies promise to provide fast,
 non-volatile, byte-addressable memories: spin-torque transfer RAM (STT-RAM),
phase change memory (PCM), and memristor-based memories. In the following
sections we briefly introduce each of them.

\textbf{Phase Change Memory} is a promising non-volatile byte-addressable
memory technology. PCM is built with Chalcogenide-based materials, which has
two states, crystalline state and amorphous state. By
injecting current to heat the memory cell to a high temperature for a period
of time, the material crystallize and the resistence reduce. To reset the cell,
apply a large enough current for a short period to melt down the
material and it transition into amorphous state with higher resistence.
 These two states can be read as "1" and "0". As transition into crystalline
state requires longer current injection, PCM has slower writes comparing to
reads.  
As heating causes contraction of the cell, PCM has limited write endurance
up to $10^8$ cycles.
 
\textbf{Spin-Torque Transfer RAM} STT-RAM uses magnetic properties of 
certain materials and electric charges to enable different persistent states 
in memory cells. Each cell of STT-RAM has two ferromagnetic plates, with
one holds a particular polarity permanently, while the other can change the
polarity. If the two plates have the same polarity, the cell stores "1",
otherwise it stores "0". By applying a current STT-RAM can change the polarity
of the plate with soin-transfer torque.
STT-RAM promises potential of unlimited write cycles, and
current prototype using tunneling magnetorresistence showed 32ns for
read latency and 40ns for write latency, with 0.3mA power consumption
per cell~\cite{sttram}. The disadvantage of STT-RAM is shrinking cell size is
extremely difficult.

\textbf{Memristor memory} is a resistive RAM device. Applying electric field
changes the resistence of the memristor device, and different resistence level
can be read as 0 or 1. Recent research on memristor indicates that its
performance could be comparable to DRAM, with write endurance up to $10^{10}$
cycles. Currently memristor is still under development in the laboratory.
