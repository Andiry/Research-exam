abstract     = {<p>Today’s databases and key-value stores commonly keep all their data in main
                memory. A single server can have over 100 GB of memory, and a cluster of such
                servers can have 10s to 100s of TB. However, a storage back end is still required
                for recovery from failures. Recovery can last for minutes for a single server or
                hours for a whole cluster, causing heavy load on the back end. Nonvolatile main
                memory (NVRAM) technologies can help by allowing near-instantaneous recovery of
                in-memory state. However, today’s software does not support this well.
                Block-based approaches such as persistent buffer caches suffer from data
                duplication and block transfer overheads. Recently, user-level persistent heaps
                have been shown to have much better performance than these. However they require
                substantial application modification and still have significant runtime
                overheads.</p>

                <p>This paper proposes whole-system persistence (WSP) as an alternative. WSP is
                aimed at systems where all memory is nonvolatile. It transparently recovers an
                application’s entire state, making a failure appear as a suspend/resume event.
                Runtime overheads are eliminated by using “flush on fail”: transient state in
                processor registers and caches is flushed to NVRAM only on failure, using the
                residual energy from the system power supply. Our evaluation shows that this
                approach has 1.6–13 times better runtime performance than a persistent heap, and
                that flush-on-fail can complete safely within 2–35{\%} of the residual energy window
                provided by standard power supplies.</p>},
