\section{Access model} 
\label{sec:access}

With the emergence of non-volatile memory, the accessing model needs
to be re-considered. Accessing non-volatile memory addresses several
challenges: how to create and manage non-volatile memory, how to ensure
consistency during system failures, and how to avoid common programming
bugs, such as dangling pointers, multiple free()s, and locking errors.

\nvh{}~\cite{nvheaps} and \mnem{}~\cite{mnemosyne} try to address these issues
and propose solutions to the non-volatile memory accessing models.

\nvh{} creates a lightweight system that exposes the performance of the
non-volatile memories and also ensures safety in the presence of
application and system failures by avoiding common programming errors.
It provides safe access to persistent objects with pointer safety and
flexible ACID transactions, and makes persistent objects easy to program.

\nvh{} is implemented as a C++ library under Linux. It manages
the NVMM with a memory allocator, and uses a gabbage collector to recycle
persistent objects. It also provides transaction support and atomic sections 
to provide concurrency and consistency against system failure.

\nvh{} addresses the volatile pointer and non-volatile pointer issue by
only allowing pointers within a single NV-Heap (intra-heap NV-to-NV pointers)
and pointers from volatile memory to a NV-Heap (V-to-NV pointers). This is
because pointers from an NV-Heap to volatile memory (NV-to-V pointers) do
not make sense when the system reboots, and inter-heap NV-to-NV pointers become
unsafe if the NV-Heap that contains the object is not available. By enforcing
this pointer restriction and checking pointers dynamically \nvh{} provides
pointer safety guarantee.

\nvh{} uses reference count to track dead objects and recycle them. When 
the reference count to an object reduces to zero, the deallocation routine 
atomically calls the destructor and deallocates the object. As the deallocation
is atomic, the deallocator can resume work after system failure without error.

\nvh{} uses undo log to provide ACID transaction support. Whenever application
wants to modify an object, \nvh{} makes a copy of the original object to
the write log and then updates the object. If system fails during
the transaction, \nvh{} rolls back the object to its original copy by using
the copy in the log.

\nvh{} exists as normal files in a file system, and it uses DAX
\texttt{mmap()} to map the NVMM pages directly into the application's
address space. Application must explicitly declare persistent objects in
\nvh{} and access the objects with caution. This adds overhead to the
programming but \nvh{} exerts to export simple interface for programmer
and hide the details.
