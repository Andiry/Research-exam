\section{Conclusion: Quill}
\label{sec:conclude-quill}

\Muse{} allows programs to access files stored in fast, non-volatile memories
without going through the operating and file system while still preserving the
protections they provide.  We have shown that \Muse{} can reduce latency for
small accesses by up 2x and improve bandwidth by 7x.  \Muse{}
demonstrates that it is possible to expose most of the performance of these
memories for file access without significant changes to the operating or file
system.

\ignore{Our
experience with \Muse{} also illustrates areas where additional support from
the file system and operating system could improve performance.}

it possible to increase a file's length from user space or supporting large
virtual memory pages).}
